Netpython - A python computer networking utility tool for reading from and writing to network connections (TCP/UDP).


A feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool written 
in python. We have made this as a netcat-like tool. This netpython 
was created by @hex0x00, check the file readme.txt for further 
details.

Netpython is a 'python netcat' with all the networking features. 
Netpython is a custom tcp/udp network tool used for reading or 
writing from TCP and UDP sockets like network debugging, port 
scanning, transferring files, and port listening, ... and it 
also can be used as a backdoor shell (pentesting). It's a good 
investigation tool for administrators, programmers, and pen
testers.

Netpython is a netcat alternative solution for minimize cyber 
attacks and avoid Anti-virus trigger false positives. Read the
readme.txt to know details.

USAGE:

  Listen:  python3 np.py -lvp [PORT] [-OPTIONS]**

  Connect: python3 np.py -t [ADDRESS] -p [PORT] [-OPTIONS]**

  Scan:    python3 np.py -t [ADDRESS] -p [MIN_PORT-MAX_PORT] -z [-OPTIONS]**

====
Example usage:


- python3 np.py -lvp 4444 -e cmd

- python3 np.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 4444

- python3 np.py -lusCp 5000

- python3 np.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 1000-8000 -z

- python3 np.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8000-8081 -e /bin/bash -u

- python3 np.py -l -p 8080 -e myprogram.type


====
Some basic features:

  * Full forward and reverse DNS lookup
  * Port scanning
  * Transferring files
  * Port listening
  * Traffic dumping
  * Used as a backdoor
